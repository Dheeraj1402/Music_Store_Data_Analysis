# Music_Store_Data_Analysis

The Music Store Data Analysis project focuses on analyzing a music store's database to gain valuable insights into business performance and customer behavior. By leveraging SQL (Structured Query Language), the project performs data analysis on various aspects, such as customer purchases, music genres, and overall sales trends. The primary objective is to explore and understand key metrics that help evaluate how the store is performing, who the top customers are, and which music genres are the most popular among different customers.Each table captures distinct aspects of the music store's operations, ranging from customer information to details about individual songs and invoices. Through SQL queries, the project analyzes the relationships between these tables, such as linking customer purchases with music tracks or determining the spending behavior of customers in different regions.

# Project Structure

invoice_line.csv: Stores information about individual lines in each invoice.
media_type.csv: Contains data about different media types.
playlist.csv: Contains playlists created by users.

# Technologies Used

PostgreSQL: The project uses PostgreSQL, an open-source relational database management system, to store and manage the music storeâ€™s data.

pgAdmin: A web-based GUI tool is used to interact with the PostgreSQL database, execute SQL queries, and visualize the data results.

SQL: Structured Query Language is used to write queries for data retrieval, analysis, and manipulation. SQL is critical for deriving meaningful insights from the data.
